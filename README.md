# Math-Knights
Education base math game for first graders

As part of the CMPT*322 class we made a Unity game called Math Knights. As a part of a team of three I learned to understand the concepts and techniques of software design. This project offered a lot of freedom which challenged my creativy but at the same time it made me critically think my own skills and what is possible to accomplish within the timeline. Math Knights was an education based math came designed for first grades. A player could make a profile and explore the map to choose a level to play. To get more lives agains the math monster the player had to answer correclty to basic math questions. After playing the player could see their progress and try to get more right answers and beat the math monster faster. This project taught me a lot and made me want to learn more. During this time our team faced multiple issues which made me improve my problem solving skills. Through this project I understood the power of communication, as the better we communicated the better results we accomplished as a team.
